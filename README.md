# Overflow-CSGO
# Internal CSGO cheat - work in progress
#### I work on this when im bored so there may or may not be updates. Its goal is to be an HvH cheat but currently its only got legit stuff.

Written in snake case (for the most part, %95)

Base used:
https://github.com/designer1337/csgo-cheat-base

Injecting Steps:
1. Download the git and install the included .tff font icon file
2. go to, C:\Users\your name\Documents and create a folder called "overflow
3. add the Default file config included in the git to that folder.
4. Build in x86 and manual map.
5. Add -disable_d3d9ex in steam csgo launch options for skins to not be black

In the future ill remove the need for manually creating the directory
